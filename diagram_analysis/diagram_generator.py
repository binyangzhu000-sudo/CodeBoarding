    unchanged we drop the rebuilt edge and take the baseline verbatim; edges touching a

    between two unchanged components is discarded — so both relabel and structural drift
    against untouched components is eliminated. Relations are keyed by ``(src_id, dst_id)``,
    the stable component identity; the rebuild always populates both ids.
