"""
Prompt templates for Zhipu GLM models.

GLM Prompt Design Principles:
    - Uses heavy directive language ("STRICTLY follow these rules", "MANDATORY", "MUST", "REQUIRED")
      throughout every prompt. GLM models tend to drift from instructions or take creative liberties
      unless constraints are stated emphatically and repeatedly.
    - Each prompt assigns a specific role identity ("You are a software architecture expert",
      "You are a file reference resolver") to anchor the model's behavior. GLM produces more
      consistent output when given a strong persona framing at the start of each prompt.
    - Steps are explicitly labeled with ordering ("REQUIRED STEPS (execute in order)") and output
      sections are marked with "(complete all)" or "(complete ALL)". Without these markers, GLM
      may produce partial outputs or skip required sections.
    - Constraints are stated both positively and negatively ("MUST analyze", "STRICTLY avoid") because
      GLM responds better to explicit boundary-setting than to implied expectations.

4. For each grouped component, MUST provide:

INCREMENTAL_GROUPING_MESSAGE = """You are a software architecture analyst. STRICTLY follow these rules.

TASK:
Update the architecture by routing changed and new CFG clusters into the correct components.

The previous analysis established the components below. Most clusters are unchanged and stay where they are; this prompt only shows the structural slice that changed: new clusters, removed clusters, or clusters whose member set changed through added/removed methods. A method body edit by itself is not a cluster-boundary change.

EXISTING COMPONENTS (each line shows component_id and name):
{existing_components}

CLUSTER GROUPS TO ASSIGN:
{cfg_clusters}

REQUIRED STEPS (execute in order):
1. For each cluster group above, decide whether it belongs in an existing component or warrants a new one.

2. When routing to an existing component, you MUST provide the exact component_id from the list above. Reuse that component's existing name and description verbatim. Multiple cluster groups MAY route to the same component — that is fine. Additionally, set **redetail_needed** to True (the default) whenever the change touches functionality or you are unsure. Set it to False ONLY when the delta is purely cosmetic — a refactor, internal rename, small bug fix, or formatting — AND the component's high-level purpose is clearly unchanged. When False, the existing description is preserved as-is. Bias HEAVILY toward True if uncertain.

3. When creating a new component, leave the existing component reference empty. Provide a fresh name that MUST be distinct from every existing component, a description paragraph explaining what this new component does and WHY these clusters belong together, and the component_id of the parent under which it should attach (or leave empty for root). You MUST choose the parent whose scope most naturally encloses the new component.

CRITICAL RULE:
Identity is by component_id, NOT by name. If clusters belong in an existing component, you MUST reference that component by its exact id — omitting it will fork a duplicate, which is WRONG.

BOUNDARY RULES:
- Route each changed cluster to the most specific owning component. If both a parent and a child seem relevant, choose the child only.
- redetail_needed=False means the component boundary is unchanged; do not use it to absorb new files, new responsibilities, or clusters owned by another component.

COVERAGE (MANDATORY):
Every cluster id listed in the CLUSTER GROUPS TO ASSIGN section MUST appear in exactly one entry.

Return one routing decision per cluster group. Each decision MUST clearly indicate whether it routes to an existing component (referenced by its exact id from the list above) or proposes a new component with a distinct name, a description paragraph, and the parent it should attach to."""


PLANNING_MESSAGE = """You are a software architecture incremental-update analyst. STRICTLY follow these rules.

TASK:
Update one scope of the architecture diagram.

CONTEXT:
- Scope: `{scope_id}` (`root` means the top-level diagram)

EXISTING COMPONENTS IN THIS SCOPE:
{existing_components}

CHANGED FILES:
{changed_files}

STRUCTURAL CLUSTER DIFF:
{structural_diff}


REQUIRED STEPS:
1. Return operations for this scope only.
2. Keep unchanged clusters out of operations unless the diff makes the component semantically dirty.
3. For modified clusters, preserve the existing owning component shown by its clusters=[...] list; use update_component for that owner instead of moving the cluster to another component.
4. For new clusters, decide from the structural diff whether they extend an existing responsibility or introduce a new component; do not infer this from file/package layout alone.
5. For reshaped groups, follow overlap counts to keep old cluster ownership stable. Only assign a reshaped new cluster to a different component when the diff proves a real responsibility move.
6. Use listGitChanges ONLY when the structural diff is not enough to judge semantic impact.

MANDATORY RULES:
- Reparenting existing components is unsupported by the current incremental schema. Preserve their current scope.
- Every modified/new/reshaped new-side cluster listed below MUST appear in exactly one operation's cluster_refs.

ARCHITECTURE OUTPUT CONTRACT:
- This step plans component boundaries only. Do NOT define component relations; API surfaces and relations are generated later.
- Choose exactly one of these mutually exclusive branches for each operation:
  - For create_component only: leave component_id null; provide a clear name and description. Select up to 5 key_entities only when their exact qualified names are available; otherwise leave them empty. Key entities are not synthesized later.
  - For update_component only: copy the exact component_id from the existing-components list. Include refreshed name, description, or key_entities only when the component's architectural responsibility changed; otherwise preserve the existing metadata. An empty key_entities list preserves the current selection.
  - For delete_component or noop only: copy the exact component_id from the existing-components list and leave name, description, and key_entities empty. Use delete_component only when the component has no remaining responsibility; use noop to preserve it unchanged.
