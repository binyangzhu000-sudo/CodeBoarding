Prompt templates for DeepSeek models.

DeepSeek Prompt Design Principles:
    - Uses markdown headers (# Task, # Instructions, # Required outputs) for clear hierarchical
      structure. DeepSeek models are trained heavily on code and technical documentation, so they
      parse and follow markdown-structured prompts more reliably than prose-style instructions.
    - Instructions are labeled with explicit ordering ("execute in order") because DeepSeek can
      otherwise reorder or skip steps when given unordered lists.
    - Prompts are concise and technically direct, avoiding role-playing preambles. DeepSeek performs
      best with matter-of-fact instructions focused on what to do, not who it is.
    - Avoids XML tags and heavy formatting. DeepSeek doesn't benefit from these structural cues the
      way Claude does; plain markdown hierarchy is sufficient and produces cleaner outputs.

INCREMENTAL_GROUPING_MESSAGE = """# Task
Route each changed or new CFG cluster into the correct component — either an existing one or a brand new one.

The previous analysis established the components below. Most clusters are unchanged and stay where they are; this prompt only shows the structural slice that changed: new clusters, removed clusters, or clusters whose member set changed through added/removed methods. A method body edit by itself is not a cluster-boundary change.

# Existing components
Each line shows the component id and its name:
{existing_components}

# Cluster groups to assign
{cfg_clusters}

# Instructions

1. For each cluster group listed above, decide whether it belongs in an existing component or requires a new one.

2. If routing to an existing component, reference it by its exact component id from the list above (e.g. `"1.3"`). Reuse that component's current name. Include the cluster ids that now belong there. Multiple groups of clusters can route to the same component if they are functionally related.

3. Decide whether the component's description needs updating. Default to yes. Only skip the update when the change is cosmetic — a refactor, internal rename, small bug fix, or formatting change that does not alter the component's high-level purpose. When in doubt, request the update.

4. If creating a new component, give it a fresh name distinct from every existing component, write a description explaining what this component does and why these clusters belong together, and specify a parent component id to attach it under (or leave it at root level). Choose the parent whose scope most naturally encloses the new component.

# Critical rule
Identity is by component id, not by name. Reusing an existing component's name without explicitly referencing its component id will fork a duplicate — that is wrong. When clusters belong in an existing component, always reference that component by its id.

# Boundary rules
- Route each changed cluster to the most specific owning component. If both a parent and a child seem relevant, choose the child only.
- redetail_needed=False means the component boundary is unchanged; do not use it to absorb new files, new responsibilities, or clusters owned by another component.

# Coverage
Every cluster id listed in the "Cluster groups to assign" section must appear in exactly one output entry."""

# Existing components in this scope

# Structural cluster diff
{structural_diff}


# Instructions
Return operations for this scope only.

1. Keep unchanged clusters out of the operations unless the diff makes the component semantically dirty.
2. For modified clusters, preserve the existing owning component shown by its clusters=[...] list; use update_component for that owner instead of moving the cluster to another component.
3. For new clusters, decide from the structural diff whether they extend an existing responsibility or introduce a new component; do not infer this from file/package layout alone.
4. For reshaped groups, follow overlap counts to keep old cluster ownership stable. Only assign a reshaped new cluster to a different component when the diff proves a real responsibility move.
5. Use listGitChanges only when the structural diff is not enough to judge semantic impact.

# Critical rules
- Reparenting existing components is unsupported by the current incremental schema. Preserve their current scope.
- Every modified/new/reshaped new-side cluster listed below must appear in exactly one operation's cluster_refs.

# Architecture output contract
- This step plans component boundaries only. Do not define component relations; API surfaces and relations are generated later.
- Choose exactly one of these mutually exclusive branches for each operation:
  - For create_component only: leave component_id null; provide a clear name and description. Select up to 5 key_entities only when their exact qualified names are available; otherwise leave them empty. Key entities are not synthesized later.
  - For update_component only: copy the exact component_id from the existing-components list. Include refreshed name, description, or key_entities only when the component's architectural responsibility changed; otherwise preserve the existing metadata. An empty key_entities list preserves the current selection.
  - For delete_component or noop only: copy the exact component_id from the existing-components list and leave name, description, and key_entities empty. Use delete_component only when the component has no remaining responsibility; use noop to preserve it unchanged.
